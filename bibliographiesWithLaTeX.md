**Bibliographies with LaTeX**
===



*In our modern days, package [biblatex](www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) in
conjunction with [biber](www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) are commonly used to
generate a bibliography, or reference list. Packages like natbib or cite along
with BibTeX, or even creating a bibliography manually are considered old and
obsolete, though many journals still use them.*

A quick change for experienced users
-------

Biblatex and biber are a great team. biblatex comes with a variety of predefined
styles for citations and references. Those can be modified pretty easily as
well. The [biblatex-support-page](http://www.ctan.org/topic/biblatex) lists
additional styles. The modern bibliographyprocessor biber has some advantages
over the conventional BibTeX, for example full utf8-support and hence better
sorting. Experienced LaTeX-users that made the switch to LyX can also be happy,
[LyX is compatible with biblatex](http://wiki.lyx.org/BibTeX/Biblatex).
